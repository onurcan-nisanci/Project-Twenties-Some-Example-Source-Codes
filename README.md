# About
In this repo, I shared some of the C# source code files with you. It's a demo project that I worked as a solo developer in my free time. Game set in 1920s Prohibition Era America and there is an experienced agent whose mission to fight against underworld crime organization.

* I used C# language with Unity2D game engine. 
* I handled all 2D physics, rendering, animations, particle-sound effects, level loadings and UIs from the engine.
* My main purpose was focusing and improving myself on the Object Oriented Programming concepts such as: 
**Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Interfaces, Singleton, Eagerly-Lazy Loading, Separation of Concerns, DRY principle (Don't repeat yourself) etc..**
