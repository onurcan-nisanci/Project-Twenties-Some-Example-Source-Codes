# About
It's a demo project that I worked in my free time. Game set in 1920s Prohibition Era America and there is an experienced agent whose mission to fight against underworld crime organization. 

In this repo, I shared some of the C# source code files with you. I mainly focused on the Object Oriented Programming concepts such as: 
**Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Interfaces, Singleton, Eagerly-Lazy Loading, Separation of Concerns, DRY principle (Don't repeat yourself) etc..**
